## Overview of Product
We will be building an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This application allows users to log in and create a profile for themselves. They will also be able to take a quick aptitude test to determine what job/ business would be a good fit for them from the list available. They can then submit an application to that role. Applicants will be able to see all the roles available to them, as well as their own applications and any interviews they have been invited to take. 

There will also be a back-end recruiter view of the website that shows recruiters the different applicants, what their test scores were, and any jobs they’ve applied to. Recruiters will have the ability to progress, reject and hire applicants, as well as move their application to a different role. 

The app looks like the below:

## Why is this important
As a recent graduate, or someone who would like to apply to a role in a complex organization, it may sometimes be hard to figure out what role you would be a good fit for. Our aptitude test cuts out the need to open all jobs and read through a job description to find a role that fits. It also reduced the risk of the company losing out on qualified/ good, diverse candidates who may have applied to the wrong role by guiding them in the right direction.


## User Story

I want to ensure that people are applying to the appropriate role
So that I get the most qualified applicants

AS a young college student in the job market

So that I have a better chance of being selected/ getting an offer
